### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Doyoung Kim from South Korea.

I am a M.S. Student at the Language & Knowledge Lab at [KAIST AI](https://github.com/kaistAI/), advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/). My lifelong research goal is to solve undiscovered problems beyond the spatiotemporal limitations inherent to humans using AI. As a starting point for the goal, I am particularly interested in two main areas, which are also my research direction for my graduate study:

(1) Exploring a better alternative to current NTP supervision for Language Modeling.
(2) Making LLM a general planner.

Reach out to me via [my email](doyoungkim@kaist.ac.kr) if you have any questions, or would like to collaborate with me!
