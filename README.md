Hi, I am an MS student studying language models. I am a member of Language & Knowledge Lab at [KAIST AI](https://github.com/kaistAI/), advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/). Before studying language models, I completed my BS in Mathematics & Computer Science(double major) at KAIST.
        
My primary research objective revolves around developing a generalist decision making AI model. I hypothesize that the model mirrors the cognitive processes through which humans perceive, learn, and navigate their environment. My aim is to identify a processing and learning algorithm that allows AI to implicitly construct a robust world model, leveraging it internally to effectively explore its surroundings and uncover novel insights not explicitly provided during training. As a starting point for the goal, I am currently interested in following topics:


(1) Interpreting how LLM perceive the world through world model.

(2) Enhancing contemporary transformer structure and training scheme for robust decision making.

(3) Reasoning/planning in compositional, long-horizon tasks(especially in language and robotics domain).


I am currently finding for an open PhD position starting from fall 2025. I am also finding for a visiting research/internship position starting from fall 2024/spring 2025.

Feel free to contact me via email if you have any questions!
