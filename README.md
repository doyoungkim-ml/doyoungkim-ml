### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Doyoung Kim from South Korea.

I am a M.S. student studying LLM at the Language & Knowledge Lab at [KAIST AI](https://github.com/kaistAI/), advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/). Before studying LLM, I completed my BS in Mathematics & Computer Science(double major) at KAIST.
        
        My lifelong research goal is to solve undiscovered problems beyond the spatiotemporal limitations inherent to humans using AI. As a starting point for the goal, I am particularly interested in two main areas below, which are also my research direction for the graduate study:

        (1) Exploring a better alternative to current NTP supervision for Language Modeling
        
        (2) Making LLM a general planner.

Feel free to contact me via email if you have any question!
